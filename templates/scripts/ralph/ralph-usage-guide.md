This ralph setup is based on https://x.com/ryancarson/status/2008548371712135632

This is guide for human and AI agent should ignore this file.

### How It Works
A bash loop that:
Pipes a prompt into your AI agent
Agent picks the next story from prd.json
Agent implements it
Agent runs typecheck + tests
Agent commits if passing
Agent marks story done
Agent logs learnings
Loop repeats until done

### Memory persists only through:
Git commits
progress.txt (learnings)
prd.yaml (task status)


```
scripts/ralph/
├── ralph.sh
├── prompt.md
├── prd.yaml
└── progress.txt
```

## ralph.sh

The loop:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

MAX_ITERATIONS=${1:-10}
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname \
  "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

echo "🚀 Starting Ralph"

for i in $(seq 1 $MAX_ITERATIONS); do
  echo "═══ Iteration $i ═══"
  
  OUTPUT=$(cat "$SCRIPT_DIR/prompt.md" \
    | claude --dangerously-skip-permissions 2>&1 \
    | tee /dev/stderr) || true
  
  if echo "$OUTPUT" | \
    grep -q "<promise>COMPLETE</promise>"
  then
    echo "✅ Done!"
    exit 0
  fi
  
  sleep 2
done

echo "⚠️ Max iterations reached"
exit 1
```

Make executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/ralph/ralph.sh
```


## prompt.md
Instructions for each iteration:

```markdown
# Ralph Agent Instructions

## Your Task

1. Read `scripts/ralph/prd.yaml`
2. Read `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
   (check Codebase Patterns first)
3. Check you're on the correct branch
4. Pick highest priority story
   where `passes: false`
5. Implement that ONE story
6. Run typecheck and tests
7. Update AGENTS.md files with learnings
8. Commit: `feat: [ID] - [Title]`
9. Update prd.yaml: `passes: true`
10. Append learnings to progress.txt

## Progress Format

APPEND to progress.txt:

## [Date] - [Story ID]
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered
  - Gotchas encountered
---

## Codebase Patterns

Add reusable patterns to the TOP 
of progress.txt:

## Codebase Patterns
- Migrations: Use IF NOT EXISTS
- React: useRef<Timeout | null>(null)

## Stop Condition

If ALL stories pass, reply:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

Otherwise end normally.
```

## prd.yaml
Your task list:
```yaml
branchName: ralph/feature
userStories:
  - id: US-001
    title: Add login form
    acceptanceCriteria:
      - Email/password fields
      - Validates email format
      - typecheck passes
    priority: 1
    passes: false
    notes: ""
```

Key fields:
- `branchName` — branch to use
- `priority` — lower = first
- `passes` — set true when done


## progress.txt
Start with context:

```markdown
# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2024-01-15

## Codebase Patterns
- Migrations: IF NOT EXISTS
- Types: Export from actions.ts

## Key Files
- db/schema.ts
- app/auth/actions.ts
---
```


Ralph appends after each story.
Patterns accumulate across iterations.

## Running Ralph

run the ralph script with 25 iterations

```bash
./scripts/ralph/ralph.sh 25
```

Ralph will:
- Create the feature branch
- Complete stories one by one
- Commit after each
- Stop when all pass
